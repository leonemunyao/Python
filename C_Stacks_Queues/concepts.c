// Both stacks and queues in C are data structures that can be implemented using either array or linked lists. 

// What is a Stack in C. 
// A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO rule(Last In First Out). In stack both insertion and deletion take place
// from just one end, that is from the top. We can implement a stack in C in two ways. We have statically and dynamically.

// Statically - Array implementation of stacks allow the satic memory allocation of its data elements. Its important to note that
// in this method, the stack acquires all the features of an array.

// Dynamically - Linked list implementation of stacks follow the dynamic memory allocation of its data elements. Its important to
// note that in this method the stack inherits all the characteristics of linked list in C.

// Array Implementation of stack in C
// The C stack functions basically include: Insertion, Deletion, Display. Stack Overflow, Stack Underflow.
