""" We create a new class using the class statement and the name of the class. This is followed by an indented block of statements which
 form the body of the class. In this case we  have an empty block which is indicated using the pass statement. For our verification we 
 confirm the type of the variable by simlpy printing it. It tells us that we have an instance of the Person class in the __main__ 
 module"""
