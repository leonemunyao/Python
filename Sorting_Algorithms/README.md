In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequent used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms that require input data to be in sorted lists.

Sorting algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.
